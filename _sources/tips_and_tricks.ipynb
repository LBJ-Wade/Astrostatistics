    "We are mostly using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) in this class, though we will also show examples in [Python](https://www.python.org/).  Julia comes with its own package manager; for Python, I recommend using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which is a minimial set of packages based around the `conda` package manager. \n",

    "Of course, you only need to use Julia or Python if you want to execute the codes in the class notebooks; feel free to use your own favorite language and modelling languages.  (I love learning new languages, too, so if you find something I don't know about already, I'll be extra happy.)  Beware, though: the course moves fast, and we're mostly interested in the *conceptual* issues around our statistical analyses, not the *computational* ones; so if you're using a language / library stack where you have to start by writing your own MCMC kernels, you'll probably not be able to keep up!"
