# PHY 688: Computational Astrophysics Syllabus

## Course Information

* Title: PHY 688: Special Topics in Astrophysics: Computational Astrophysics
* Meets Tu-Th 1315 to 1435 in Frey Hall Room 326
* Description: Course in computational astrophysics focusing on modeling and data analysis.  We will be exploring analysis of astrophysical data sets using specialized computational tools and domain specific languages.  We will focus on model building, model checking, and model extension to capture information about the relevant physics and data generation process for a data set.
* Course Material will be posted on blackboard, and lecture materials will be collected [online](https://farr.github.io/Astrostatistics/intro.html) and associated code can be found [here](https://github.com/farr/Astrostatistics).

## Instructor Information

* Instructor: Will M. Farr <will.farr@stonybrook.edu>
* Office Hours: By appointment.

## Course Learning Objectives

Upon completion of the course, students will

* Be able to build, check, and extend models of astrophysical data generating processes to extract physical understanding.
* Be able to fit models so constructed to realistic data sets using modern computational tools and languages.
* Be able to explore and assess engineering tradeoffs between model complexity / realism and analysis efficiency.
* Be able to clearly and meaningfully extract and present results from model fits.
* Be able to collaboratively critique and build fitting code and results.

## Course Topics

* Regression and curve fitting.
* Colored noise.
* Gaussian processes and regression.
* Populations and catalogs of objects.
* Selection Effects.
* Special methods: variational inference, likelihood-free/simulation-based inference, ....

## Grading, Attendance, Late Work

The course grade will be determined by a weighted average of homework (40% weight), project (40% weight), and participation (20% weight) grades.  Points and feedback for graded activities will be posted to the My Grades area on Blackboard.

Periodic assignments will be announced on blackboard.

The course will involve a project: an extensive analysis of an astronomical data set with a presentation and writeup of the results.  

Attendance and participation in class is expected; nevertheless students are permitted to miss class occasionally without penalty for professional (conference attendance, collaboration meetings, etc) or personal (family situation, transportation difficulties, etc) reasons.  Excessive absences will impact the student's participation grade; additionally some material appears only during the in-class discussion and will be missed.  In the midst of a global pandemic, students are *required* to miss class and isolate should they be exhibiting symptoms of or test positive for COVID-19; make-up discussions with the instructor and materials will be arranged.

Assignments and projects are expected to be completed and handed in by the due date; reasonable requests for extensions for professional and personal reasons (see above) will be entertained generously.

## University and Course Policies

### Student Accessibility Support Center Statement

If you have a physical, psychological, medical, or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact the Student Accessibility Support Center, Stony Brook Inion Suite 107, (631) 632-6748, or at sasc@stonybrook.edu. They will determine with you what accommodations are necessary and appropriate. All information and documentation is confidential.

Students who require assistance during emergency evacuation are encouraged to discuss their needs with their professors and the Student Accessibility Support Center. For procedures and information go to the following website: https://ehs.stonybrook.edu/programs/fire-safety/emergency-evacuation/evacuation-guide-people-physical-disabilities and search Fire Safety and Evacuation and Disabilities.

### Academic Integrity Statement

Each student must pursue his or her academic goals honestly and be personally accountable for all submitted work. Representing another person's work as your own is always wrong. Faculty is required to report any suspected instances of academic dishonesty to the Academic Judiciary. Faculty in the Health Sciences Center (School of Health Technology & Management, Nursing, Social Welfare, Dental Medicine) and School of Medicine are required to follow their school-specific procedures. For more comprehensive information on academic integrity, including categories of academic dishonesty please refer to the academic judiciary website at http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/academic_integrity/index.html

Any form of academic dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism, will be reported to the Academic Judiciary

### Critical Incident Management

Stony Brook University expects students to respect the rights, privileges, and property of other people. Faculty are required to report to the Office of University Community Standards any disruptive behavior that interrupts their ability to teach, compromises the safety of the learning environment, or inhibits students' ability to learn. Faculty in the HSC Schools and the School of Medicine are required to follow their school-specific procedures. Further information about most academic matters can be found in the Undergraduate Bulletin, the Undergraduate Class Schedule, and the Faculty-Employee Handbook.
